# Julia Roguelike Example
A simple demo of a roguelike starter in Julia just to show how it would be done from scratch.

Notes: if you have trouble with ncurses with a "file too short" make sure your libncurses.so is actually a lib and not just a symbol reference to a lib. You can also put "libncurses.so" in the directory.
